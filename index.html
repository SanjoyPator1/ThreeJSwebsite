        <h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Projects</h2>

        <h3>Sign Language Recognition in Real time</h3>
        <i>TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV</i>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>We want to make it easy for 70 million deaf people across the world to be independent of translators for their daily
              communication needs using our project
              </li>
            <li>Custom dataset is used to train our model - hand gestures</li>
            <li>Model is trained on various architechtures inorder to compare the accuracy</li>
            <li>The final model that works best is saved</li>
            <li>The saved model is used to translate the sign language into text</li>
          </ul>
        </p><br>

        <h3>Vaccine Details India |</h3>
        <i>Flutter</i>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Since few people in India still don‚Äôt know how to look for available slots using the official website and more over it
              is not efficient - finding the vaccine there</li>
            <li>So our app will easily help people know when the slots are available in full details</li>
            <li>User can search for available slots according to state-¬ødistricts or by pin-code</li>
            <li>App is published on Google Play store and it is getting a good review from the public in India</li>
          </ul>
        </p><br>

        <h3>MediCloud</h3>
        <i>Java, Android studio, firebase</i>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Developed an android app that lets user store the previous medical record in the cloud. In case of Emergency if the
              doctor doesn‚Äôt have the medical record then the procedure of treatment/surgery can be different which may cause
              critical health issues.
              </li>
            <li>So our app will help the doctor to get the necessary records of the patients at the time of emergency</li>
            <li>Still trying to put some extra features so that it can be released for the general public at Google Play Store in the
              near future.</li>
          </ul>
        </p><br>

        <h3>Vision For Everyone</h3>
        <i>Java, Python, Firebase, tensorflow, django, flask</i>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Developing an android app that can help the people with disabilities</li>
            <li>Input - gestures/touch, voice recognition Output - voice output and haptic feedback</li>
            <li>Some of the features are - using the android camera objects will be detected and the location along with the object
              name will be given to the user</li>
            <li>Other features include OCR - so that user can know the contents of any text e.g - book / newspaper / expiration
              date of food items etc
              </li>
            <li>This project is still in continuation - most of the android part is done while the other half - machine learning part is
              not completed yet</li>
          </ul>
        </p><br>

        <h2>üèÜ Leadership and Achievements</h2>
